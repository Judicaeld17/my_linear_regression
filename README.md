# Welcome to My Linear Regression
***

## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
In this project we have to get and analyse existing data in order to find tendecies and generalize.
The challenge in the project is to implement our custom linear  and logistic regression algorithm starting from data 
visualization to model otimization.

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
To acheive our aim we first visualazed the data we generate.Then we develop a set of fucntion in order to create a kind of
pipeline for model traning and visualization.

The following functions had helped us in this process: 
`Linear hypothesis function`
`mean_squared_error`

On top of function we also write classes that handel model creation, fitting ,prediction and model performance optimization.
The two classes are : LeastSquaresRegression() and GradientDescentOptimizer()


## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
Nothing need to be installed
## Usage
How does it work?
The notebook just need to be 
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
